# Personal Growth

A personal accountability and growth tracking system.

## Purpose

This repository serves as my central hub for:
- **Learning & Insights**: Capturing knowledge from AI conversations and research
- **Project Mastery**: Documenting and understanding my work projects deeply
- **Goal Tracking**: Setting and measuring progress toward personal and professional goals
- **Reflection**: Regular review of progress, patterns, and areas for improvement

## Structure

```
/chatgpt-history/       # Exported ChatGPT conversations organized by topic
/claude-history/        # Claude conversation exports and insights
/projects/              # Work project summaries and learnings
/goals/                 # Goal setting, tracking, and reviews
/weekly-reviews/        # Weekly reflection and planning
/skills/                # Skills I'm developing with progress notes
```

## Principles

1. **Consistency over intensity** - Small daily actions compound
2. **Measure what matters** - Track progress, not just activity
3. **Learn from patterns** - Review history to identify what works
4. **Bias toward action** - Document to clarify thinking, then execute

## Getting Started

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for how to export and organize conversation history.
